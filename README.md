# AW.ClaimsExpressions

This project provides a simple Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for validating JWT claims. It defines an expressive grammar that allows users to create complex claim validation rules using logical operators (and, or, not) and claim checks (e.g., exists, equals, contains, startsWith, endsWith).
